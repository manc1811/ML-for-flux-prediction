# ML-for-flux-prediction
In this project, we Worked on an ML model that predicts  the hllc flux values in Fluids which  saves a lot of computational time, simultaneously providing 98.67% accuracy.
We Manually generated the dataset(with 60k data points)  from scratch and performed data cleaning operations.
We Used Artificial Neural Networks and libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn,etc. to make the prediction model.
Our model takes in six input parameters and predicts 3 output values. These values corresponds to the u,v,and p values at the interfaces of the domain cells.
